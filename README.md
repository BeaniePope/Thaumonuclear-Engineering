# Thaumonuclear-Engineering
God, it's getting really hot in here. I thought magical nuclear generators were safer?



Github Repo for the very opensource and open for you to mess around with Thaumoengineering I am partaking in to make life easier for late game Thaumaturges like a friend of mine, because while I've never played Thaumcraft, while I was building a nuclear reactor, my friend was warping reality; and I feel like along the way we'd be able to generate power from that

For now, this mod is extremely WIP and should not be run unless you fancy breaking everything you hold dear as I have no idea how this will handle. All coding backend seen here is written by me (BeaniePope), the wonderful people at StackOverflow, and whoever else decided to contribute to this cesspool of hell. 

Yeah, that's it. Thanks for reading!
